# P1_Graph-Compression-Techniques-for-Personalized-PageRank

C++20 implementation of the NodeRemoval algorithm presented in [Preserving personalized pagerank in subgraphs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3104482.3104582).

The program expects a list of nodes and an edge list representation of a graph as input (in.txt) and outputs the compressed graph (out.txt).

The Python file contains utility functionality for creating, converting, and computing PageRank on graphs.
